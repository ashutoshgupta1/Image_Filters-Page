# Image_Filters-Page
I am new to Github and this was a trial to learn to use github. 
Please ignore the commits and not commenting in code because as I said this was a TRIAL.
This is miniproject I built using basic technologies and wanted a place to show it off :)
MORE GREAT PROJECTS TO COME IN SHORT TIME using more advanced tech(I am learning)!
